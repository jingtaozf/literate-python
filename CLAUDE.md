# Literate Agent — Shared LP Doctrine

This file aggregates the literate-programming rules maintained in
`~/projects/literate-agent/rules/`. A consuming repository imports
this aggregator from its own `CLAUDE.md` with a single line:

```
@~/projects/literate-agent/CLAUDE.md
```

Claude Code inlines this file (and the rules it `@`-imports) at
load time, so each repo gets the full LP doctrine without
maintaining a local copy.

## Dual-audience design (research-grounded)

These three rules derive from the 50-iteration transfer-gradient
research; see `docs/transfer-gradient.org` for the figure + the
6 shared-primitive families + the catalogued anti-patterns.

## Cowork (human + AI agent author pair)

These five rules codify the protocols that emerged across 6+ months
of ${PROJECT_NAMESPACE} + <meta-repo> + cmux cowork practice. They extend
the dual-audience reader research to the dual-author authoring
question. The proposed deepening loop is documented at
`docs/cowork-research.org`.

## Agent-native phenomena (research-grounded)

These five rules derive from the third research loop on phenomena
that exist /because/ an AI agent participates — no human-human
research precedent strong enough to anchor on. See
`docs/agent-native-phenomena.org` for the figure + 6 families + 8
observations.

## LP source-drift roundtrip (v4 — proposal stage)

These two rules codify the metadata contract for the source-drift
roundtrip workflow consumed by `skills/lp-resync/`. See
`draft.org § 2026-05-22-lp-resync-roundtrip` for the design doc.

## Language-specific LP hints (lazy-loaded)

The `hints/` folder contains language-specific LP caveats. They
are **NOT** `@`-imported into this aggregator (would bloat
context). Instead, they auto-activate via per-language skills
when you edit a matching file type:

| Language | Auto-activates on | Hint file |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Elisp | `.el` files (skill: `lp-hint-elisp`) | `hints/elisp.org` |
| Python | `.py` files (skill: `lp-hint-python`) | `hints/python.org` |

When editing a literate `.org` file that contains `#+BEGIN_SRC <lang>`
blocks, also consult `hints/<lang>.org` for that language's traps.

There is also a *cross-audience* hint:

| Topic | Auto-activates on | Hint file |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| Dual-audience section review | user asks to "review section" / "check this section" (skill: `lp-dual-audience-check`) | `hints/dual-audience-checklist.org` |

See `hints/README.org` for the convention and how to add a new
language.

## Pre-commit integration (LP protocol verification)

Consumer repos can gate `git commit` on .org-file LP protocol
consistency via the `lp-protocol-verify` hook shipped here. Add to
your project's `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/jingtaozf/literate-agent
    rev: main   # or pin a SHA
    hooks:
      - id: lp-protocol-verify
```

Then:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

What it checks (per-staged-.org-file, ~50ms-300ms):

| Invariant | Catches |
|-----------|---------|
| V1 schema | missing/malformed SHA, BLOCK_KIND value, NOWEB_PARENT resolve |
| V2 :CONTAINS_DEFS: | stale def list after manual block edit (without --refresh-defs) |
| V3 noweb integrity | orphan <<chunk>>; noweb-leaf with bad NOWEB_PARENT |
| V4 :tangle paths | dangling :tangle target |
| V5 source parseable | source file with syntax error |

V6 (tangle round-trip, runs `make tangle-all`) is excluded from
pre-commit — too slow. Run in CI on PR via:

```bash
python3 scripts/lp_protocol_verify.py <lp-root> --full
```

Two lighter hooks also available — see `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`:

- `lp-audit-metadata` — V1 only (faster, no tree-sitter)
- `lp-audit-anchors` — :CUSTOM_ID: coverage on multi-ref headings

## LP build / lint commands (typical project layout)

Drop the `templates/Makefile.lp.mk` fragment into your project to
get a working set of targets:

```bash
include $(HOME)/projects/literate-agent/templates/Makefile.lp.mk
```

That gives you:

```bash
make tangle FILE=lp/<sub>/<x>.org      # tangle one .org
make tangle-all                        # tangle the whole tree
make check-structure                   # depth ≤ 5, prose-before-src
make build-index                       # regenerate lp/INDEX.org
make build-tangle-map                  # refresh .cache/tangle-map.tsv
make build-readme                      # regenerate READMEs from .org metadata
make check-tangle-drift                # re-tangle + per-sub git diff
make measure-docs-first                # prose-density snapshot
```

The hooks key off `LITERATE_AGENT_TANGLE_MAKE_TARGET` and the
`/lp-check` slash command keys off `LITERATE_AGENT_*` env vars
(see README for the full list).

## Auto-tangle lifecycle

`.org` edits trigger tangle automatically through two paths that
both end at `org-babel-tangle-file`:

1. **PostToolUse hook** on Edit / Write / MultiEdit — the
   `tangle-org-buffer.sh` hook calls `emacsclient` first, falls
   back to `make tangle FILE=…`. Gated behind `LP_AUTO_TANGLE=1`
   until each consuming project verifies per-formatter byte-
   equivalence.
2. **Manual** — `make tangle FILE=lp/<sub>/<x>.org`.

Set `LITERATE_ORG_NO_AUTO_TANGLE=1` to bypass the hook for bulk
patches.

## Maintenance cadence

- *Quarterly*: review the `> *Last-validated*:` date on each rule.
  Drop any rule whose date is > 6 months old AND has no triggering
  incident. Bump the date when a rule is re-confirmed.
- *Quarterly*: run `make build-tangle-map` and diff against
  `.cache/tangle-map.tsv` — drift here means an `.org` `:tangle`
  header changed without the cache being refreshed.

## Tangle-map cache

The PreToolUse hook (`block-tangled-edit.sh`) consults
`.cache/tangle-map.tsv` for a reverse lookup from tangled output
path → owning `.org` source. See [`docs/tangle-map-schema.org`](./docs/tangle-map-schema.org)
for the file format and how to regenerate it.

## Notes for consuming repos

Examples in the rules reference the `${PROJECT_NAMESPACE}` and `<meta-repo>`
codebases (the rules' birthplaces). Adapt module prefixes, file
names, and tangle targets to your own project — the *principles*
are project-neutral.

If a rule's examples are too distracting for your codebase, import
only the rules you want individually instead of importing this
aggregator. For example:

```
@~/projects/literate-agent/rules/literate-programming-document-first.md
@~/projects/literate-agent/rules/lp-prose-no-self-narration.md
```

### Path-scoped rules (future: on-demand loading)

Several rules have `paths:` frontmatter (`**/*.py`, `**/*.org`,
`**/*.el`). Currently they load unconditionally via the `@import`
chain because `--plugin-dir` does not support `rules/` directories
(skills, hooks, agents, and MCP only). If Claude Code adds plugin
rule support, these frontmatter values will enable on-demand loading.
